Project Overview: Wallet App
Description
This project is a comprehensive wallet application built using Turborepo, featuring a full-stack Next.js app for the frontend and backend, and a dedicated backend for managing banking webhooks for on-ramp transactions. The app leverages PostgreSQL as its database, with Prisma ORM for efficient data management, and NextAuth for secure authentication.

Features
User Authentication and Security:

Robust authentication via NextAuth ensures secure access to the application.
Sensitive data handling and secure transactions implemented with Prisma ORM.
Wallet Functionality:

Users can seamlessly transfer money from their bank accounts to their wallet.
Wallet-to-wallet transfers allow users to send money to friends using unique IDs.
All transactions are safeguarded with Prisma transactions and locking mechanisms to prevent any discrepancies or mishaps.
Banking Webhooks:

The dedicated backend handles banking webhooks to manage on-ramp transactions.
Transactions are only credited to the user's wallet upon verification from the bank, ensuring security and reliability.
Technical Stack
Frontend & Backend: Next.js (React-based framework for server-rendered and static web applications)
Backend: Custom backend for banking webhooks
Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
Authentication: NextAuth
Highlights
Modularity and Code Reusability: Utilizing Turborepo, the codebase is highly modular, with reusable components, promoting a clean and maintainable code structure.
Prisma Transactions and Locking: Ensures data integrity and prevents race conditions during money transfers.
Secure Transfers: Money is only credited to the wallet after bank verification, adding an extra layer of security.
Banking Webhooks: Efficient management of on-ramp transactions.
Future Enhancements
While the current frontend is functional, future iterations will focus on enhancing the UI/UX to make the application more attractive and user-friendly. Additional features such as transaction history, notifications, and budgeting tools are also planned to provide a more comprehensive wallet experience.

Conclusion
This wallet app is a robust and secure platform for managing money transfers. It stands out with its strong focus on transaction security, thanks to the implementation of Prisma transactions and locking, and its reliance on bank verification to ensure the authenticity of transfers. The modular code structure, achieved through Turborepo, enhances maintainability and reusability. Despite its minimalist frontend, the application offers a reliable and efficient solution for managing personal finances.
